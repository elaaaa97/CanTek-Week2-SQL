# CanTek-Week2-SQL

This project is an assignment for cantek's data analysis program. This is about creating a PostgreSQL database for a DVD rental company.

DATA contains 15 tables:
actor
address
category
city
country
customer
film
film_actor
film_category
inventory
language
payment
rental
staff
store
And the relationships between tables are shown in this ERD paradigm.
